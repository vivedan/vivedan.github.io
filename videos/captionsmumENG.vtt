00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.860
So, the place where I spend more time...

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.820
horas efectivas
effective hours would be my workplace, 
in my studio.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.570
Here I start in the mornings at work

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.850
and even if I have freedom 
to distribute my schedule,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:01:01.489
and even if we all eat lunch together
and I have to cook before that,

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.220
at the end of the day 
I spend a lot of hours here, in my office.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:19.590
This is quite new, 
because it wasn’t part of the house before.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.840
It’s a room that was done 
much later after we started living here...

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.131
many years later.

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:34.280
And it wasn’t used at all, 
it was an open terrace,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.409
next to the bedroom, the master bedroom.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.499
And we decided to make the most out of it 
and be able to use it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:55.340
in a way that doesn't give us extra work, 
because being open

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.200
it was just getting dirty, 
lots of dust and leaves when it was windy.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.100
So we decided to close it and make it part of the bedroom. 
Close it and create a new ambient.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.370
It is what we achieved and I’m very comfortable here

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.540
to be honest.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.140
But it still is my workplace,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.650
so here you live a bit of everything, good moments, 
some with a lot of tension and nerves,

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.320
a bit of everything.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.860
But it’s also true that 
it’s a very comfortable space,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.010
and sometimes I like to be here just reading for a while 
not having to be working on the computer.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.530
It’s nice, it’s a nice room. 
I also have it close to my bedroom

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:01.600
so it feels like it’s my own space. I feel 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.380
at peace.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.800
I have always liked this area, always.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:15.410
When I was little, my brother in law had here a huge piece of land 
and we would spend part of our summer

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.200
here in La Cañada, 
the neighbourhood where we live now.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.100
And I have always felt attracted to it, 
as if it was pulling me.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.250
Then, my father got sick unfortunately,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.870
and we thought that here

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.390
we would be giving him a better quality of life 
than in a flat in the city.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.980
We are here living...23 years.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.640
My children came here when they were little, 
very little, the youngest one was a baby.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.180
And it has almost formed itself,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.810
we have all contributed to 
the making of this home together.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:12.290
However, there have been times when, 
tired of such a big house

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.590
in terms of meters,

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.810
I have thought of moving to a different place.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:27.180
But I have wonderful memories here, 
really moving ones that I think

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.960
won’t make it even possible 
to think about moving ever again.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.630
The space I like the least in this house would be...
the basement.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.650
We had it before as a garage.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.710
For a while we parked the car inside, because

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.330
it has direct access to the kitchen 
and that’s convenient.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.860
But that didn’t compensate for the floods we had here.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.939
We set here a ping pong table, 
where they have spent hours playing.

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.729
I didn’t, I’m really bad at it, 
but they have played for hours,

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:13.060
a really long time, 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.210
and enjoyed and had so much fun.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.009
Now it is closed as you can see behind me, 
there’s a window.

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:26.719
This was the garage door, behind me

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:32.430
was the entrance to the garage, with a steep slope.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.110
So when it rained 
it was flooding all the basement.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.520
It was affecting everywhere, 
I have another area on my right,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.430
two more rooms that also belong to the basement, 
and everything was flooded.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.080
Then obviously, we couldn’t have here any furniture

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.889
because everything was getting swollen...we had to change the doors.

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:05.060
Until we decided to change this.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.580
I think it’s underdeveloped.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.580
We use it as storage.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:22.199
It has a lot of potential, 
we could join all the space that we have,

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.770
the other two rooms and this one

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.419
and even make a new dwelling,

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.189
for one of my children if they wanted or

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:38.349
were interested at some point. 
I’m not sure, my son who is an architect

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.660
and my daughter-in-law who is an architect as well, 
they should be the ones who take care of it.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.939
I’m just bothered with it being used as storage.

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:52.300
It still is a relief for the rest of the house,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.889
but well, it’s not what I would like it to be.

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:02.059
My favourite space, and the one that I enjoy the most, 
is the living room.

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:10.699
Was I resting or reading...
it’s where I feel most at ease.

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.440
Except in summer obviously, 
when I prefer other areas.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:20.349
The living room is my favourite space.

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:25.939
This house gives me serenity, peace...

00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:29.409
it’s very quiet, the only things that one can hear 

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:40.419
are my dog barking and the birds singing, 
it’s very nice.

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:45.219
Memories… my family.

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:47.710
All the memories are my family.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:53.120
I feel very attached to the lamp 
in the dining room,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.310
which is part of this same room, 
it’s all one same space, one piece.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.939
The lamp, 
it took a long time to choose it, I think

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:05.969
we made the right choice and it’s a good lamp.

00:08:05.969 --> 00:08:10.330
The Lladró figurines behind me

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.369
also have sentimental value, 
not so much for me

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:20.309
but for my husband 
since they are gifts from patients.

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:25.839
Almost all of them, 
except two little ones that are not so important

00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:29.740
but also of great sentimental value

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:36.130
because they are from the tombolas 
we used to organize in the school of my children.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:41.909
And well, I was lucky that I won them.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.880
There are also paintings 
that patients gave my husband as presents,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.380
that are very valuable because they were made

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:55.410
with great care and appreciation.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.570
This is what I can highlight.

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:22.230
So, we spend more time in the kitchen

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.800
not because we’re here often, together.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.230
Rather because otherwise,

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.000
each of us is in their own space, 
in their workplace.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Then, we are just in the kitchen...
when we come home

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.149
and come directly here.

00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:45.440
As we come home, we meet in the kitchen.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.550
We come to the kitchen and eat in the kitchen. 
I personally spend more time in the kitchen

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.630
because I am cooking.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:10:01.861
And Álvaro often keeps me company, 
sometimes while I cook or helps me

00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:02.861
in the kitchen.

00:10:02.861 --> 00:10:07.839
Then, if we are not in the kitchen we are not together, 
each one of us is in their own space.

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:12.283
Let’s hear what the others think.

00:13:03.892 --> 00:13:05.855
You don’t fancy preparing it,

00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:09.553
I mean, cooking it, 
but you do eating it.

00:13:12.146 --> 00:13:12.646
Okay.

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:15.591
Okay, okay, the cooking part,
the cooking part...

00:13:16.716 --> 00:13:17.841
Okay, okay.

00:13:37.555 --> 00:13:38.755
Yes, indeed,

00:13:38.755 --> 00:13:45.200
as I said earlier here as we are done eating, 
each one leaves to their place.

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:49.529
Sometimes the living room as Alvaro mentioned, 
others to the office,

00:13:49.529 --> 00:13:52.379
sometimes we stay in the kitchen.

00:13:52.379 --> 00:13:54.980
But it is true that it is the meeting center,

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.170
it’s where we spend the most time with the three of us together.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.856
Otherwise it’s very difficult to be together, 
if it’s not in the kitchen we are rarely together.

00:14:18.872 --> 00:14:20.766
Yes I haven’t said otherwise.

00:14:59.224 --> 00:15:05.090
Well, there’s a member of this household missing 
and who is always close to the kitchen

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.120
with us,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.689
Bimba, our doggie.

00:15:09.689 --> 00:15:13.798
Normally we have the door open, 
and she lays next to the door

00:15:13.798 --> 00:15:15.957
and watches us, stays with us,

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.747
so the meeting is for everybody, 
also for Bimba.

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:35.474
Yes, we have many options.

00:16:45.824 --> 00:16:47.790
So we have options, yes.

00:16:51.571 --> 00:16:53.206
How long are you living here?

00:16:57.409 --> 00:17:04.460
We have been living here 22 years and a half.
