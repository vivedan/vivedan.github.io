00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.580
I spend the most time here, in this office,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.820
because I have plenty of 
activities to develop

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.350
in relation with my job at the hospital, 
with the university sessions

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.920
and here it’s where I have my computer.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.520
It is not the ideal area for me,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.010
because ideal for me would be the attic 
because it allows more isolation.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.990
It is, therefore, an intermediate solution. 
I think it is positive

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.400
and it’s important to balance it and it is balanced.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.700
It grants me a bit of isolation, 
but at the same time it doesn’t turn me into an eremite, 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.240
which is what would happen 
if I had my office in the attic.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:41.090
In relation to the integration of this work space,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.000
of this extension of 
my workplaces within the house,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.610
I think there’s no other option 
but to see it naturally.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:03.330
However this prolongation 
doesn’t invade family life,

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.680
and this is very important.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:13.580
The rupture between space and time 
is not possible to the letter in

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.980
professions like mine,

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.240
and I have to adapt with flexibility 
the interaction between the two spheres.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.700
Then, this space allows me

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.560
to be here at midnight 
or one in the morning,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.110
sending emails and answering 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.140
questions that I receive, 
marking works.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.810
It gives me that, continuity.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.380
And at the same time it allows me 
to be within reach,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.950
so that if I’m requested in the kitchen

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:02.940
to do something, or if I have to 
walk the housepet, 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.030
or go to the living room 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.980
to say something, something that 
I might just read in my computer...then

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.160
I’m close at hand, 
so the transit here is quite easy.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.580
Then, it isolates me less 
than in the attic.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.360
If I were in the attic 
I couldn’t have that interaction.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.210
There’s a high chance that, if I had to redesign,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.710
to start again this project which 
in part I already found it like this,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.790
something I would leave out 
would be the basement.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.190
I come here rarely,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.960
I spend a time of my life, many years, 
working on a second basement, always with artificial light.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.050
Now, when I’m working on the examination rooms, I do it

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.960
in a system of artificial light 
because there are no windows.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:19.640
Then, I don’t feel like coming down here, 
where I have to depend on artificial light.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.910
I think that’s one of the 
motivations or explanations

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.930
to the poor attachment I feel 
to this area of the house.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:48.930
The house, or the external structure of 
the place one inhabits,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:01.620
shouldn’t if possible inform 
the life of the human being.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.910
It shouldn't.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.100
Rather the opposite, the human being is 
what gives life to the place being inhabited, right?

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:18.960
But it is true that the material conditions generate 
totally different visions.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.031
For the average humans, 
who are always on the move,

00:05:26.031 --> 00:05:35.550
home is the place to rest, 
as it was always said.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.410
The rest of the warrior is his home.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:48.370
Then, it’s important that the house has spaces

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.100
which allow a total rupture with 
the hustle and bustle,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.510
with the toil of work’s everyday nature.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.650
So a place like this,

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:15.170
which grants you such special climatic 
and chromatic conditions,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.570
it’s my favourite place.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:23.370
It is also a personal view,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.480
but I think most people would share it,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.760
maybe it’s just common sense.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.260
There are many memories, a lot.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:50.820
But offhand, besides the most recent,

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:59.710
in the distance I remember, 
essentially due to it’s human component,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:09.880
that this was the refuge 
of your grandfather last years,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.140
where he would spend his mornings sitting on 
his wheelchair, sunbathing...

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.490
and probably listening 
and seeing what we do now,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.840
with slight hints in the changes of the trees.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:38.480
And I think that those two, 
three years during which he was here

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:46.380
sunbathing on his wheelchair, 
already justify this space, they give it meaning.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.870
Because I think he was a person 
in a situation of total vulnerability,

00:07:53.870 --> 00:08:01.390
to whom this space gave something.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:15.646
It granted him peace, calm and gifted him 
quality of life during his last years.

00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:18.950
I think this, which comes offhand,

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:21.170
justifies this space.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.680
This space has already fulfilled 
its function within those three years.

00:11:27.457 --> 00:11:38.080
But, well...the reasons are 
usually different, because

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:48.310
this kitchen space, actually this kitchen space, 
if this house

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.600
was a loft, then it would be 
a very important corner.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.870
In this case it is a comfortable space,

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:04.980
with enough spaciousness for us to live, 
to eat, to watch the news while

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.030
we eat, as well as to have 
a conversation after the meal.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:22.880
And besides that, it allows each one 
to develop different actions, some cooking, some helping.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:31.870
And it also has another component, and that is 
that it has the second TV of the house,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:36.930
which is more or less within the routinary activity,

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.100
and therefore whoever doesn’t want to 
watch TV in the living room

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.810
can come here to the kitchen.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:49.860
So I think in this sense it allows 
a quite diverse activity flow.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:55.080
And I believe I am the one who spends 
less time here, because I only come here to eat,

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:01.140
but since I don’t fancy the culinary part,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.430
so...

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.905
I am talking...

00:13:07.905 --> 00:13:10.980
I am talking about the culinary part.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.350
Culinary means the cooking part.

00:13:14.828 --> 00:13:15.786
That's why...

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.720
That is the culinary part. The culinary…

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.307
That’s why I have said that I only, 
I am the one that spends less time here because I come

00:13:24.307 --> 00:13:25.829
essentially to eat, to eat.

00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:32.250
That’s the reason I say, 
I spend less time in the kitchen,

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.200
for that reason, because I don’t have

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.990
any specific activity other than eating.

00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:05.520
Well, this is an advantage in a way.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.570
This is like everything in life, 
it has a positive side. 

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:15.060
Positive in the sense that it means 
that we have enough spaciousness and space

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:20.296
as to be each of us doing 
whatever we want to do. So...

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:29.230
So, for this reason it is a space of...

00:14:32.324 --> 00:14:37.037
a meeting point in english, it is a meeting point.

00:14:37.037 --> 00:14:40.660
It is a meeting point, 
always a meeting point, right?

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:46.295
Because the house has enough 
rooms for each of us to...

00:14:50.761 --> 00:14:51.814
That's it.

00:15:19.796 --> 00:15:22.126
Indeed, indeed.

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:29.500
But well, from a realistic point of view, 

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.270
the functions of this kitchen are 
those of a meeting point.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:42.652
A meeting point in a multi-space 
as this house,

00:15:42.652 --> 00:15:47.460
a periodic meeting point during 
the course of the day.

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.839
How long are you living here?

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:05.467
Here we are living 22 years and...
6 months exactly.
