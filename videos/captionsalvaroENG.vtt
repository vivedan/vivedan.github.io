00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:34.390
The place of the house where I spend 
most of my time is the basement,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:44.980
in the office of the basement to be more precise, 
but the basement in general.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.870
It’s where I usually work, 
I have my photography studio,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.370
all my photography material, 
my laptop, a big TV,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.310
there’s also a printer and more,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.360
and also since not so many people come downstairs

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.710
I’m a bit more comfortable, 
because I can focus more

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.090
and also I can listen to music better.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:30.508
I have the door open in case somebody calls or needs me, 
but since I’m with the headphones on...

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.440
mostly so I can listen to music and focus a bit more.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.830
It’s not like I’m a stranger here 
or that I want to be away from other people,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.260
it’s just that I like to be a bit more isolated

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:56.759
to focus and listen to music.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:05.890
For me photography is really really important,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.620
since three or four years.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.800
And I would like to have it as a job,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.170
firstly because as any artist I like to express myself

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.650
and I do it best through that,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:35.110
and then also because it’s one of the things 
I can do best.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.269
I do it relatively well, I think.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.129
I like it a lot, 
I feel a lot of freedom while taking photographs,

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.980
I feel very loose.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.590
I don’t know, it’s a bit hard to describe,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.580
but I feel that it’s something that fulfills me.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:06.090
From all the things I can do, 
I think it’s what fulfills me the most.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.900
In this room, the basement, 
where I have my photography studio,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.040
the backdrop, I also have the flash,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.900
and on these shelves I have 
everything related to photography.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.440
It’s a very big space,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:33.930
which allows me to move a lot, 
and that also helps me and I also have very good lighting.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:41.159
I can switch off the lights whenever I want, 
to have only the flash on.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:51.989
I can move and change the framing a lot, 
and I like that very much.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.489
I’m very comfortable in this room,

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.829
especially regarding photography.

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:13.370
For me, it’s important to be isolated.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:21.760
This room allows me to experiment

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:34.150
with photography and video, 
and being isolated is really good for me

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:44.340
because I don’t have so much noise 
and I can focus much better.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.240
The imagination flows better.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.639
The way I can isolate myself here, 
I really don’t think it’s the same as how

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:08.560
I could be in the attic, 
especially regarding space.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:17.550
Also in the attic the roof has slope, 
so except in the center,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.660
you always need to be ducking.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.680
Maybe I would get back ache or something like that.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:35.520
Also from my point of view, 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.650
until we opened the attic

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.919
I had no idea that it existed.

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.991
However, I’ve always used the basement, 
ever since I was little, because

00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:57.000
here I had my toys and I played here a lot.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.850
But upstairs, because it was closed until ten years ago

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.270
more or less,
when we opened it and refurbished it,

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.500
I really had no idea it existed.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:27.990
After that we started using it everyday for a while,

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:35.520
but then we forgot about it.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:44.390
It became a storage more than anything, again.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:53.500
Because the difference of temperature between 
summer and winter is very different,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.580
in winter you freeze and 
in summer you melt.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:06.259
And here it happens something similar, 
but much more controlled.

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:14.379
So I think it’s the temperature,

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:30.120
and the fact that the basement has been 
part of my life for a longer time.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:37.360
Probably, I wouldn’t live...

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.139
if they told me that I would have 
the whole basement for me,

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:52.071
as a fully featured home, 
I wouldn’t live here mostly

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:56.580
because of the lack of natural light.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:08.550
Aside from the garage, 
the staircase is the only place

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:15.069
where a bit of natural light comes from.
Everywhere else has artificial light.

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:18.599
For example, there’s also no toilet.

00:08:18.599 --> 00:08:23.159
To build a kitchen here 
would probably be difficult.

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:28.420
To put a bed here isn’t difficult, 
because the space is big,

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.069
but...

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:35.630
no, not as a full home.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.830
I see this as a studio

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.447
and

00:08:43.447 --> 00:08:45.718
hobby room for me.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:23.500
I agree more or less with what my mother said,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:36.090
because it is true that when we come home, 
especially if it’s lunch or dinner time,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:43.950
we are all together in the kitchen obviously.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:49.060
And then each of us leaves to a different place,

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.800
my mum for example goes to the living room 
or the office upstairs,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:01.870
my dad to his office, 
and I go to mine.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:13.160
And, okay, I think I help my mum in the kitchen

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:20.350
a bit more than she says, but yeah, 
she said more or less...

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:26.189
I agree more or less, 
if not to a 99% with what she just said.

00:13:05.687 --> 00:13:06.872
Sure...

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:10.659
But yeah...

00:13:17.158 --> 00:13:19.543
Yes, yes, but...

00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:33.909
Privilege.

00:14:36.154 --> 00:14:39.003
Yes, sort of...a meeting point, yes.

00:14:41.448 --> 00:14:43.326
The area...

00:14:44.831 --> 00:14:50.196
We could say that the common area for us is the kitchen...

00:14:50.196 --> 00:14:55.288
Normally when we have guests it’s the living room.

00:14:55.288 --> 00:15:00.000
But for us living here it’s the kitchen...

00:15:08.138 --> 00:15:10.485
Ah okay, I thought you meant Daniel...

00:15:20.676 --> 00:15:24.417
Yes, that’s true, we forgot the poor Bimba, 

00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:27.973
I don’t think that’s fair.

00:15:48.264 --> 00:15:58.200
And also I think that as...
as you said, the good thing is that

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.160
it’s not only a meeting point 
and also where we eat, it’s also

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:12.700
sort of a second leisure room, 
because if you can’t watch TV

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.300
in the living room you can just watch it here.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.940
For example, I often watch football here

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:28.750
in the kitchen because I can’t in the living room, 
because it’s taken, and...that’s it,

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:35.540
or sometimes I watch a show here or...

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:42.228
Or you watch the news here, 
which is the usual instead of in the living room.

00:16:43.908 --> 00:16:44.786
So...

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:48.170
Yes.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.209
How long are you living here?

00:16:58.951 --> 00:17:05.335
We live here 22 years and 6 months.
